# About
Employees are frequently entitled to claim expenditures for travel that is required in order to perform their work. For instance, a London-based employee may be required to travel to Plymouth for a meeting. They could claim for transportation (e.g., subway, rail, and bus) as well as meals and beverages, as well as lodging.
Employees can use this mobile app to record details of their spending and subsequently submit them to their employer's server and this mobile app is implemented as a native Android app coded in Java.
